# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
The project aims to identify the most suitable ML algorithm for the Heart Disease Prediction. For that, I selected SVM and Random Forest. 

Introduction:
This project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for heart disease,
potentially contributing to the early detection of heart disease, thereby reducing the global death rate of
cardiovascular diseases.

Defining the ML problem:
 Task (T): Build a heart disease risk prediction tool for the next 10 years using a machine model.
 Experience (E): A dataset with details under different categories like demographic, behavioral,
past, and current medical conditions will be used to train the model.
 Performance Metric (P): To measure the performance of the model, metrics like Accuracy or Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) will be used.
